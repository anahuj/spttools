Usage:
1. sptparser tree.spt > newtree.txt
2. emacs newtree.txt (or any other text editor)
3. sptcompiler newtree.txt > newtree.spt

In this release (20081027) about all individual parameters
have been documented. Extensive modifying of the trees is
possible.

But more documentation on the structure will be needed:
What should be done if a branch level is added?
A leaf map? A frond map? A collision object?

Also a tool such as a composite map creator would be
essential to have. Bezier splines are editable in the textual
form but a graphical editor would be nice (see ngplant).


Notes:

1. Changing individual numeric values will probably work, but
we don't know the value ranges.

2. Changing the tree structure is largely unknown process. Addition of
a new branch level requires changes in multiple places (sections 1014,
6000, 15000, 16000 and probably in 13000 and 14000, and 26000, 50000,
70000).

3. The values listed inside { } of Bezierspline are the control points
with the point, tangent vector, and tangent length/weight info.
 (control point 1) x1 y1 u1 v1 w1
 (control point 2) x2 y2 u2 v2 w2
The first and last control points have x = 0 and x = 1 respectively.
Other x values are in increasing order: x1 <= x2 <= ... <= xn.
Tangent vector is a unit vector: u^2 + v^2 = 1.

TODO:

1. The byte and short integer numbers may have problems with
negative numbers. E.g., -1 may be 255.

2. What is a pair of printf() and scanf() which preserves the floats?
The pair
  printf("%f\n",f); scanf("%f\n",&f);
won't. Now we use the pair
  printf("%.16f\n",f); scanf("%f\n",&f);
which prints out too many trailing zeros.

3. GUI similar to SpeedTreeCAD, but without the tree generation
and rendering. The tree generation and rendering would be of
magnitudes harder project.

4. Texture tools.

5. SpeedTreeCAD clone with the tree generation and rendering.
Hard project but would be useful for faster visual feedback.
Now each change can be seen only by viewing the tree in the game.
The tree generation and rendering need not be of the quality
of SpeedTreeCAD and nor the quality of SpeedTreeRT.
It is enough if our generated and rendered tree would look
similar to what is generated and rendered by SpeedTree products
in the games.
Our editor could output NIF data and an embedded Nifskope could
be used for rendering.
